# Projection Matrix for HMDs

Sorry for these not really being nuggets, but more of citations/link lists.

- Posts by Oliver Kreylos:
  - [How to Measure Your IPD](http://doc-ok.org/?p=898) - just follow the "TL;DR" version at the top.
  - Importance of correct calibration of HMDs: [post 1](http://doc-ok.org/?p=756), [post 2 - followup](http://doc-ok.org/?p=764) The video in the first post is also quite interesting and useful.

- Robert Kooima, "Generalized Perspective Projection." <http://csc.lsu.edu/~kooima/pdfs/gen-perspective.pdf> - primarily regarding non-head-worn displays, which are somewhat simpler because there's not much in the way of optics between display and eye.
