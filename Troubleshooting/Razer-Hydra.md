- **Having trouble with a Razer Hydra**
  - If you're running the Razer Hydra tray-icon, close it, then unplug/replug. (Consider removing it if you don't have other uses for it - OSVR does not require it) If you're using SixenseSDK-based applications, you may need to unplug/replug or reboot to put the Hydra back in a known state, especially if server startup appears to detect two Hydra devices.
