# Roadmap
- In September 2015, RoadToVR published an article by Yuval Boger of Sensics about the OSVR roadmap. It is an excellent starting point to understand the OSVR big picture and roadmap. [The article can be found here](http://www.roadtovr.com/osvr-roadmap-creating-an-ecosystem-of-interoperable-vr-hardware-and-software/).
- The [OSVR Waffle Board](Roadmap/waffle.md) contains an overview of issues currently in GitHub issue trackers for all OSVR framework projects.
