# OSVR Waffle Board
The [OSVR Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/osvr/osvr-core) contains an overview of issues currently in GitHub issue trackers for all OSVR framework projects. It summarizes the issues in a number of lists:

  - Those under "Contributions Wanted" are likely to be the easiest entry points into contributing, though in some cases they may simply be tasks that require skills that existing contributors do not have.
  - Those under "Ready" are not blocked by any other issues and are approved for development for integration.
  - Those under "In Progress" should typically show a user who is working on them - if you want to take on a task, move it here and assign yourself.
  - The "Done" list should be self-explanatory - it contains closed issues from the past 7 days (automatically removed).
  - All issues not otherwise assigned to a list end up in "Backlog". You're welcome to work on these (whether through verification, triage, or development), though please use the issue thread to communicate your plans and progress.
  - Of course, the issue lists are not all-encompassing: if you've got a contribution you'd like to make, we'd love to see it! Filing an issue on the right project would be a great first step.
