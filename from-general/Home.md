This repo is for issues that are larger than a single project/repo in OSVR.  This wiki, correspondingly, is for notes and information that pertain to more than just one repo.

Note that internal links in the wiki should be made this way: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-links-to-wikis/  New pages need to manually be added to the sidebar in an appropriate organization, if applicable.

Adding images should be done in the wiki's backing store (Git repo) - see <http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2014/03/how-to-add-images-to-github-wiki.html>
